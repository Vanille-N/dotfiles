# i3status configuration file.
# see "man i3status" for documentation.

# It is important that this file is edited as UTF-8.
# The following line should contain a sharp s:
# ß
# If the above line is not correctly displayed, fix your editor first!

# Note about the powerline stuff
# To put a divider with the powerline arrow in a module you add
# use <span background='COLOR OF MODULES BG' foreground='COLOR OF BARS BG'></span>
# and use the same code at the end of a format, where background
# is the color of the bars bg, and foreground is your modules bg
# it might not be the best approach, but how I tinkered my way to it
